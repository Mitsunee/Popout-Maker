> Utility to generate custom Popout Windows with any browser

Popout-Maker is a small utility I made to have an easy way to open a page inside of a popup window.

## What are popup windows?

Popup windows are smaller browser windows that are intentionally missing some features like toolbars, status bars. This makes them very useful for saving space on your screen.

### Example

> This is a standard Google Chrome browser window showing google.de. Notice how it shows the list of tabs and icons in and around the adress bar. Usually there'd also be a row of bookmarks below that.

> Here's the popup window version of google.de in the very same browser. The tab row and icons around the adress bar are gone. Some browsers will even go as far as hiding the adress bar as well. Of course the bookmarks are also hidden (this is the case in any browser).

## YouTube Popouts

There is also dedicated pages for YouTube and Twitch popouts. The YouTube-version automatically converts video page and or playlist links to embed links, so only the actual video is visible in the popout.

## Twitch Popouts

The Twitch-version instead takes only the channel name and opens a similar popout that optionally also includes the chat:
