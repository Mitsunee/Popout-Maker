# Popout-Maker
### Utility to generate custom Popout Windows with any browser


![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mitsunee/Popout-Maker/master/assets/icon64.gif) Popout-Maker is a small utility I made to have an easy way to open a page inside of a popup window.

## What are popup windows?


Popup windows are smaller browser windows that are intentionally missing some features like toolbars, status bars. This makes them very useful for saving space on your screen.

#### Example

![Standard Browser Window Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mitsunee/Popout-Maker/master/assets/gitimg1.png)
> This is a standard Google Chrome browser window showing google.de. Notice how it shows the list of tabs and icons in and around the adress bar. Usually there'd also be a row of bookmarks below that.

![Popup Browser Window Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mitsunee/Popout-Maker/master/assets/gitimg2.png)
> Here's the popup window version of google.de in the very same browser. The tab row and icons around the adress bar are gone. Some browsers will even go as far as hiding the adress bar as well. Of course the bookmarks are also hidden (this is the case in any browser).

## Current status:


The current version (1.0) is a stable release version. The youtube-specific version was remade and finished and `<label>` tags were added to improve the interface.

## Current goals:


- Twitch-specific version
- *twitch:* js funstufftm to get rid of black bars automatically (but ask for permission once)
- Better CSS styling
- *forms* horizontal lists with shifting background div?
- add `<noscript>` warnings
- Using PHP to allow presets via GET variables
- Adding buttons to copy or bookmark a preset-link
- A small wiki showcasing all preset variables and a general guide for all 3 versions
- redo this file
