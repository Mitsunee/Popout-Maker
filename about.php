<h2>About The Project</h2>
Popout Maker is a sideproject of mine. I made it because I loved using the popout-button YouTube sadly removed a few years ago. I also sometimes play flash games by ninjakiwi, that also don't have a popout button.
<h2>Recommended Software to use with Popout Maker</h2>
I will be collecting a variety of little apps and programs, that work awesome with Popout Maker, here.
